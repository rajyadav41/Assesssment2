# Solidity Token(Metacrafters)

The solidity program is a simple "Token Manager" with mint and burn functionalities. It demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the Solidity programming language.

## Description

This program is a smart contract written in Solidity, a language for developing smart contracts on Ethereum. The contract has two main functions:
Mint: Increases the total supply of tokens and adds tokens to a specific Ethereum address.
Burn: Decreases the total supply of tokens by removing tokens from a specific Ethereum address.
It uses a mapping data structure in Solidity to map Ethereum addresses to their token balances.

## Getting Started

### Clone the repository

* Clone the repository or just download the zip file.

### Executing program
To run and test the smart contract:

Use Remix: Go to Remix IDE, an online IDE for Ethereum smart contracts.

Load the Contract: Upload the metacrafters.sol file into Remix's workspace.

Compile: Click the compile button in Remix to compile the Solidity code.

Deploy: Deploy the compiled contract by clicking the deploy button next to the compile button.

Test Functions: Once deployed, you can test the mint and burn functions by providing appropriate values (like addresses and token amounts).
